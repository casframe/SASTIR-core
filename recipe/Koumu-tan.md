《香霧湯麺(Koumu-tan)：Taste the Chinese soup noodle as you read》 
Story text:

A moment before the fog lifted, I heard my mother's voice behind the steam..." 
Kindness is always in every bite.

Recipe (1 serving, less than 10 minutes, no knife required):

Ingredients

1 ball vermicelli or thin Chinese noodles (dried instant noodles OK)

2 teaspoons chicken broth

1 teaspoon sesame oil

1 to 2 cm tube ginger

Tube garlic (omit if you don't like garlic)...a little

1 handful cut vegetables (bean sprouts, cabbage mix, etc.)

1 egg

1 teaspoon soy sauce

A pinch of white sesame seeds or chopped green onion (if available)

Directions:

Boil water (about 400ml) in a pot.

Add chicken broth, ginger and sesame oil.

Add cut vegetables and cook for 1 to 2 minutes.

Add vermicelli (or noodles) and cook as indicated on the package.

Finally, beat in the egg and add soy sauce to taste.

Serve in bowls and sprinkle with white sesame seeds and green onions, if desired.

Taste Notes:

Top: steam from the ginger and the nostalgia of sesame oil

Middle: Gentle sweetness of vegetables and softness of egg

Base: Relief from the chicken broth × Relieving texture of the noodles

Poetry:

The place to return is beyond the steam--it's a diary read by taste.
